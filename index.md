## Scope and Objectives

Recent advances in computer vision, artificial intelligence, markerless motion capture, and XR systems are reshaping remote healthcare, from home-based rehabilitation to telepresence-enabled surgery and medical training.  
This session welcomes technical, methodological, and clinical contributions that combine XR with AI-driven movement analysis for telemedicine, telerobotics, and adaptive rehabilitation.

We particularly encourage works that:

- Leverage real-time pose estimation, depth sensing, or markerless tracking for motor assessment and therapy.
- Integrate multimodal sensor fusion (e.g., wearables, cameras, depth, IMUs) for robust movement analysis.
- Design closed-loop serious games and adaptive XR systems for personalized rehabilitation and engagement.
- Automate motor scoring, functional assessment, and outcome prediction with AI methods.
- Explore XR-supported operating theatre scenarios, tele-mentoring, and training for surgeons and therapists.
- Bridge engineering innovation with clinical validation in real-world healthcare environments.

The goal is to showcase scalable, evidence-based workflows that enable personalized care, immersive telepresence, and next-generation medical education in telemedicine and rehabilitation.
